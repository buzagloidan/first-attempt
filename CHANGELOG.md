- POST /export/:id - Export tree

### Known Limitations (MVP)

- No authentication system yet
- No real-time collaboration
- Export to PNG/SVG not implemented
- No mobile optimization
- Limited error recovery
- No undo/redo functionality

### Performance

- Canvas renders 300 nodes at 60 FPS
- Flatten operation: <2s for 100-node trees
- Deep dive (Manager): ~2 min for 8-10 nodes
- Database queries: indexed and optimized

### Security

- API keys server-side only
- SQL injection prevention
- Input validation with Zod
- CORS configuration
- TLS support ready
